# Real-Time Systems Laboratory Project:

## Weather Station and Alarm Clock

### Introduction

This project is part of the Real-Time Systems course (IST 2024/2025) and involves designing and implementing a **Weather Station and Alarm Clock** using the **PIC16F18875 microcontroller**. The project is developed on the **Curiosity High Pin Count Development Board** and emphasizes real-time embedded systems programming without an operating system. The implementation uses modular design, state machines, and low-level hardware control to achieve functionality while optimizing power consumption.

### Features

#### 1. Clock Functionality
- Displays current time (hh:mm:ss) on the LCD.
- Supports alarm clock functionality with configurable alarm time.

#### 2. Sensor Monitoring
- **Temperature**: Uses the TC74 temperature sensor to read and monitor temperature values.
- **Luminosity**: Reads luminosity levels using the onboard potentiometer, emulating light levels.

#### 3. Alarms
- Generates alarms when:
  - Temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
  - Luminosity exceeds a predefined threshold.
  - Alarm time is reached.
- Alarm signals:
  - **Visual**: Displays `CTL` on the LCD and toggles corresponding LEDs.
  - **PWM**: Modulates LED brightness for alarms.

#### 4. Data Storage
- Stores sensor readings (temperature, luminosity, timestamp) in non-volatile EEPROM memory.
- Maintains maximum and minimum recorded sensor values.

#### 5. User Interface
- **Inputs**: Two buttons (S1, S2) for configuration and data retrieval.
- **Outputs**: 
  - 4 LEDs for system status indication.
  - LCD (2x16 characters) for displaying current time, sensor data, and alarms.

#### 6. Power Management
- Optimizes energy usage by entering **SLEEP** mode during idle periods.

### User Interface

#### Buttons
- **S1 (RB4)**:
  - Clears alarm signals.
  - Enters configuration mode and cycles through editable fields.
- **S2 (RC5)**:
  - Increments values in configuration mode.
  - Cycles through saved maximum/minimum records in normal mode.

#### LCD Display
##### Normal Mode
- Displays:
  - Current time (`hh:mm:ss`).
  - Temperature (`ttÂ°C`) and luminosity (`l`).
  - Alarm statuses (`CTL` if triggered, `A` if enabled).

##### Configuration Mode
- Allows modifying:
  - Clock time.
  - Temperature and luminosity thresholds.
  - Alarm enable/disable status.
  - Reset maximum and minimum records.

#### LEDs
- **D5**: Clock activity (blinks every second).
- **D4**: Alarm signal (PWM-modulated).
- **D3**: Temperature exceeds threshold.
- **D2**: Luminosity exceeds threshold.
